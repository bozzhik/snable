# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Snable is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates entirely within your browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information.

## Data Collection and Usage

- We DO NOT collect any personal information
- We DO NOT track your browsing history
- We DO NOT store any website data
- We DO NOT transmit any information to external servers
- We DO NOT use cookies or any tracking mechanisms

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates by:

1. Extracting data from the current webpage (e.g., colors, fonts, and other visual elements) only when activated
2. Processing all data locally in your browser
3. Displaying results immediately without storing any data
4. Clearing all extracted data once you close the extension

## Permissions

The extension requires only the "activeTab" permission to:

- Access the current webpage's visual elements when you activate the extension
- Perform data extraction and analysis of visible elements (e.g., colors, fonts)
  This permission is used solely for the functionality of the extension.

Additionally, the extension retrieves the following data from the active tab:

- **Favicon**: The icon associated with the active tab (if available)
- **URL**: The URL of the active tab
- **Title**: The title of the active tab

This data is used to display relevant information about the current webpage (e.g., the page's title and URL) and provide insights into the webpage's visual elements. This data is collected only when the extension is activated and is processed locally within your browser without being transmitted to any external servers.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or stored, there are no security risks associated with data handling.

## Updates

We may update this privacy policy as we improve the extension. Any changes will be reflected here and in the extension documentation.
